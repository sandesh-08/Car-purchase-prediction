# Car-purchase-prediction

Dataset of male and female with different age group , salary is given
this program is to predict who will purchase car using knn method 

used standard scaler and dummy variables
used accuracy , confusion matrix for error detection

initiallly prediction is done with value n_neighbour=5
and later graph is plotted using for loop for different n_neighbour.
we also show confusion matrix for wrost prediction as well as best prediction.
